Description:
I needed an extra monitor on my system, but the hardware wouldnt allow.

So I put another desktop on my table, with a 4th monitor, and used this program to remotely control the mouse and keyboard.

Just mouse off the screen to the left, and automatically  take control of the remote computer's mouse and keyboard to the left. Simply mouse back to the right and control comes back to your main machine.

Based upon manaUsers version of Remote Control

Set up..
Examine the code for the port and IP addresses, you'll have to enter those in.
Then run and a menu should pop up.
You can select from a number of example functions.. one of which is to remote control the server from the client.
